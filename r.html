			<p>Most if not all of my Pair Programming and Test Driven Development practices stem from my work at Asynchrony. My iOS confidence and skillset jumped significantly as a direct result of pairing with seasoned developers as has my understanding of agile and its practice as it relates to development.</p>
			<p>I'm currently the Senior iOS Engineer on <em>lean startup</em> experiment - a crucible of sorts for new iOS hires. We're a self-organizing team of 7 building proof-of-concept products for the founders. Our current product is focussed on demonstrating iBeacon technology.</p>
			<p>I recently served as iOS tech lead on-site involving both iOS development and agile training. Day-to-day included writing stories, iterative planning and incremental coding (TDD and pair programming). My team of 3 devs built a working product along with a shared networking library currently in use (and organically growing) by 3 other teams. The core of the project involved fetching data from REST services, storing it in Core Data and then creating a dynamic Question and Answer UI based on the data that specific user retrieved.</p>
			<p>I spent my initial year with a team of 6 devs pair programming and TDD'ing a 2 year old project. We added features weekly and fixed bugs and regressions in the process. This particular project contained a chatty REST service and a heavy emphasis on <code>CALayers</code> as the interface was completely custom.</p>

			<p>I spent the majority of my time at Pervasent building their flagship product <a href="http://pervasent.com/board-papers/">Board Papers</a>. My most unique contribution to that project was an AFNetworking replica using NSOperationQueues and NSURLConnections. We obviously used UIKit and Core Data but I also got to interact with an in-house content management PDF framework that supplemented features missing from Apple's CGPDFContext for iOS - which introduced me to PDF spec.</p>
			<p>My first project at Pervasent was a social application for Oprah Winfrey - unfortunately, I don't think it was ever released. I was generally responsible for the basic UI. While on the aforementioned Board Papers project, I was added to some smaller projects as necessary and amongst other things. One of my greatest challenges was to write a tuner for Hal Lenoard's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sheet-music-direct-for-ipad/id455346511?mt=8">Sheet Music Direct</a> iPad app. It came out quite acceptable although timbre had a big effect on the final accuracy. I was also temporarily added to a Jack in the Box project as an additional dev hand and then most recently, on short notice, I filled in on a bit of work for <a href="https://www.triplespot.com/">Triple Spot</a> - basically updating XIBs to display data we were fetching via REST.</p>

			</dl>
			<p>Most of my personal apps are utilitarian and released more or less earlier in my iOS development tenure. Nested Notebooks was my first app and is a take on a hierarchical notebook for the iPhone. My Fitness Level was an app I wrote to track exercises and Bliki Wiki came out of an idea I had for a different style of hierarchical notebook for the iPad. I am working on additional app store ideas and hope to continue to find time to write my own apps.</p>

				<dd class="position">Sr. Systems Architect - Java</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>I began this position in 2004 as a Java developer. The company was small and with only 5 of us at the time, we basically managed face time with the client (which generally consisted of internal business units) and then integrated requests into a custom internal JEE web application. In my 6 year tenure, some highlights included writing a stand alone multi-threaded UNIX daemon that converted requests between two disparate systems.</p>
			<p>I wrote quite a few web applications which required a lot of database work (SQL and Oracle data models) but eventually my responsbilities turned to mentoring trainees and installing&#x2f;managing clustered Weblogic instances behind load balancers, firewalls and multiple Apache instances acting as proxies.</p>
			<p>About 6 months before I departed - Suddenlink began looking into SOA and so I was part of a team that began putting together best practices, governance policies and a migration strategy to gradually roll SOAP services to the enterprise.</p>

			<p>I essentially installed and managed MQSeries, Tuxedo and Weblogic infrastructure components for our customers. It didn't take me long to realize that I wanted to write software as opposed to being an installation Administrator.</p>
